swaygrab (1)
============

Name
----
swaygrab - Grab image data from the current sway session.

Synopsis
--------
'swaygrab' [options] [output] [file]

Grabs pixels from _output_ and writes them to _file_. The image will be passed to
ImageMagick convert for processing.

Options
-------

*-c, \--capture*::
	Captures multiple frames as video and passes them into ffmpeg. Continues until
	you send SIGTERM (ctrl+c) to swaygrab.

*-v, \--version*::
	Print the version (of swaymsg) and quit.

*-s, --socket* <path>::
	Use the specified socket path. Otherwise, swaymsg will ask sway where the
	socket is (which is the value of $SWAYSOCK, then of $I3SOCK).
